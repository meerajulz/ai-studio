# Architecture Decision Log

Every time we make a decision, we write it down here.
One entry per decision, numbered in order. Append new decisions at the bottom.

**Status** is one of: `Accepted` · `Proposed` · `Superseded by Decision NNN` · `Deprecated`

# Decision 001

Date
2026-07-09

Decision
Use Next.js App Router.

Reason
Better Server Components support.

Alternatives
Pages Router

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 002

Date
2026-07-09

Decision
Use a `src/` directory layout — all app code under `src/`, config at the repo root.

Reason
Separates application code from project configuration; cleaner root.

Alternatives
Keep `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` at the repo root.

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 003

Date
2026-07-09

Decision
Require Node.js ≥ 20.19 (develop on Node 24). Pinned via `.nvmrc` and `engines`.

Reason
Prisma 7 crashes on Node 18 (`ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`); the toolchain needs a modern Node.

Alternatives
Stay on Node 18; downgrade Prisma.

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 004

Date
2026-07-09

Decision
Use Prisma + PostgreSQL for the database layer.

Reason
Type-safe queries, migrations, and a single schema shared across the app.

Alternatives
Drizzle; raw SQL; a NoSQL store.

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 005

Date
2026-07-09

Decision
Use Better Auth for authentication.

Reason
Modern, TypeScript-first auth that integrates cleanly with the Next.js App Router.

Alternatives
NextAuth/Auth.js; Clerk; roll-your-own sessions.

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 006

Date
2026-07-09

Decision
Use Vercel Blob for media (image/video) storage.

Reason
First-class Next.js/Vercel integration for large file uploads and serving.

Alternatives
AWS S3; Cloudflare R2; Supabase Storage.

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 007

Date
2026-07-09

Decision
Keep AI integrations provider-agnostic behind common `ImageProvider` and
`VideoProvider` interfaces in `src/lib/ai/`.

Reason
Providers can be swapped or combined without changing the rest of the codebase.

Alternatives
Call each provider SDK directly from feature code.

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 008

Date
2026-07-09

Decision
Build backend and architecture first; UI last
(Architecture → Database → Auth → Storage → AI → Frontend).

Reason
The product's value is the generation pipeline; a solid backend de-risks the UI work.

Alternatives
UI-first / vertical slices per feature.

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 009

Date
2026-07-09

Decision
Keep `src/lib/utils.ts` as a file rather than a `lib/utils/` folder.

Reason
Every shadcn component imports `@/lib/utils` (the `cn()` helper); a `utils/` folder
alongside would create an ambiguous import.

Alternatives
Convert to `src/lib/utils/index.ts` (folder). Revisit if `utils` grows.

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 010

Date
2026-07-10

Decision
Host PostgreSQL on Neon (serverless), deploy on Vercel.

Reason
Free tier, excellent Postgres, automatic backups, database branching, a web UI, and
first-class Prisma + Vercel integration.

Alternatives
Supabase; Railway; local Postgres; PlanetScale.

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 011

Date
2026-07-10

Decision
Initial Prisma schema: 9 models (User, Project, Identity, UploadedMedia, Generation,
GeneratedMedia, Job, Template, FavoritePrompt). `provider`/`model` stored as strings +
`params Json`; `Generation`↔`Job` 1:1; uploaded vs generated media kept as separate
tables; per-user cascade deletes; `cuid()` ids.

Reason
Matches the spec, stays provider-agnostic (Decision 007), and separates request/result
from execution/queue state.

Alternatives
Unified `Media` table with a `kind` discriminator; Postgres enums for providers; folding
job fields into `Generation`.

Status
Accepted

---

# Decision 012

Date
2026-07-10

Decision
Prisma 7 config: connection URL lives in `prisma.config.ts` (not `schema.prisma`); the
runtime `PrismaClient` uses the `@prisma/adapter-neon` driver adapter, wrapped in a
`globalThis` singleton under `src/lib/db/`. **Implemented and verified against Neon.**

Reason
Required by Prisma 7 — `datasource.url` in the schema is no longer allowed; the client
needs an adapter or Accelerate. Neon's serverless driver suits the Vercel target, and
the singleton avoids connection exhaustion during dev hot-reload.

Alternatives
`@prisma/adapter-pg` (node-postgres); Prisma Accelerate.

Status
Accepted — implemented

---

# Decision 013

Date
2026-07-10

Decision
Use Better Auth for authentication, starting with email + password, via the Prisma
adapter over the Neon `prisma` client. Auth models (`User`, `Session`, `Account`,
`Verification`) live in `schema.prisma` (hand-written to match Better Auth's core
schema, kept consistent with the domain models — no `@@map`). Server config in
`src/lib/auth/`, browser client in `src/lib/auth/client.ts`, catch-all route at
`src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`.

Reason
Modern, TypeScript-first, integrates cleanly with the App Router and Prisma. Confirms
Decision 005. Hand-writing the models avoided the CLI failing to resolve the `@/` path
alias and kept table naming consistent with the domain schema.

Alternatives
Better Auth CLI `generate` (path-alias resolution risk); NextAuth/Auth.js; Clerk.

Status
Accepted — implemented, sign-up/sign-in verified end-to-end

---

# Decision 014

Date
2026-07-10

Decision
Auth flow UI: `/login` and `/register` use the shadcn `Form` component with React Hook
Form + Zod (`src/lib/validations/auth.ts`) and the Better Auth browser client. Route
protection is enforced **server-side** in each page via
`auth.api.getSession({ headers: await headers() })` + `redirect()` — authed users are
redirected away from auth pages, unauth users away from protected pages. A temporary
`/dashboard` renders a `UserMenu` (name/email/sign out) purely to verify the flow.

Reason
Server-side guards avoid the auth-state flash of client-only checks and are harder to
bypass. RHF + Zod gives typed validation reused from `lib/validations`. Keeping the
verification UI unstyled matches "backend-first" (Decision 008).

Alternatives
Client-side guards with `useSession`; middleware-based redirects; a shared route-group
layout guard (may adopt the layout-guard pattern for the real dashboard later).

Status
Accepted — implemented, full flow verified (redirects + session gating)
