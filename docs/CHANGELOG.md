# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project documentation set under `docs/` (PROJECT, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, DATABASE,
  AI_PROVIDERS, API, PROMPTS, CHANGELOG, DECISIONS, TODO, VISION, PROJECT_SPEC,
  NEXT_SESSION_PLAN).
- `src/`-based folder structure (`actions/`, `components/{ui,forms,gallery,upload,shared}`,
  `hooks/`, `lib/{ai,auth,blob,db,validations,providers}`, `services/`, `store/`,
  `types/`, `styles/`).
- `TooltipProvider` wired into the root layout.
- `.nvmrc` (Node 24) and `engines` field (`node >=20.19.0`).
- **Database:** Prisma 7 schema with 9 models (User, Project, Identity, UploadedMedia,
  Generation, GeneratedMedia, Job, Template, FavoritePrompt) + 3 enums; `init` migration
  applied to Neon PostgreSQL.
- **Prisma runtime client** (`src/lib/db/`): singleton `PrismaClient` using
  `@prisma/adapter-neon`, with `client.ts`, `index.ts` barrel, and a `README.md`.
  Verified end-to-end against Neon.
- **Authentication (Better Auth)**: email + password via the Prisma adapter over Neon.
  Added `Session`, `Account`, `Verification` models (+ `User` relations); `better_auth`
  migration. Server config in `src/lib/auth/` (`auth.ts` + `index.ts`), browser client
  (`client.ts`), and the catch-all route `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`. Sign-up and
  sign-in verified end-to-end (rows persisted; cascade delete confirmed).
- **Auth UI (minimal, for verification):** `/login` and `/register` pages using the
  shadcn `Form` component with React Hook Form + Zod (`src/lib/validations/auth.ts`) and
  the Better Auth client — loading states, field + server error messages, redirect to
  `/dashboard` on success, and server-side guards that redirect authed users away from
  login/register. Temporary `/dashboard` with a `UserMenu` (name / email / sign out).
  Added `src/components/ui/form.tsx` (was missing). Full flow verified via server
  redirects + session gating. Unstyled — verification only.

### Changed
- Moved `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` into `src/`.
- Updated `@/*` path alias → `src/*`; `components.json` css path → `src/app/globals.css`.
- Prisma 7: removed `datasource.url` from `schema.prisma` (now in `prisma.config.ts`);
  runtime connects via a driver adapter.

### Fixed
- Prisma generator output path → `src/generated/prisma` (was `../app/generated/prisma`);
  `.gitignore` updated to match.
