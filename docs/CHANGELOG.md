# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project documentation set under `docs/` (PROJECT, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, DATABASE,
  AI_PROVIDERS, API, PROMPTS, CHANGELOG, DECISIONS, TODO, VISION, PROJECT_SPEC,
  NEXT_SESSION_PLAN).
- `src/`-based folder structure (`actions/`, `components/{ui,forms,gallery,upload,shared}`,
  `hooks/`, `lib/{ai,auth,blob,db,validations,providers}`, `services/`, `store/`,
  `types/`, `styles/`).
- `TooltipProvider` wired into the root layout.
- `.nvmrc` (Node 24) and `engines` field (`node >=20.19.0`).
- **Database:** Prisma 7 schema with 9 models (User, Project, Identity, UploadedMedia,
  Generation, GeneratedMedia, Job, Template, FavoritePrompt) + 3 enums; `init` migration
  applied to Neon PostgreSQL.
- **Prisma runtime client** (`src/lib/db/`): singleton `PrismaClient` using
  `@prisma/adapter-neon`, with `client.ts`, `index.ts` barrel, and a `README.md`.
  Verified end-to-end against Neon.

### Changed
- Moved `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` into `src/`.
- Updated `@/*` path alias → `src/*`; `components.json` css path → `src/app/globals.css`.
- Prisma 7: removed `datasource.url` from `schema.prisma` (now in `prisma.config.ts`);
  runtime connects via a driver adapter.

### Fixed
- Prisma generator output path → `src/generated/prisma` (was `../app/generated/prisma`);
  `.gitignore` updated to match.
